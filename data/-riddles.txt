It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it you’ll die. What is it?
What always runs but never walks, often murmurs, never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, has a mouth but never eats?
The more you have of it, the less you see. What is it?
What English word has three consecutive double letters?
What’s black when you get it, red when you use it, and white when you’re all through with it?
All about, but cannot be seen, Can be captured, cannot be held, No throat, but can be heard.
Until I am measured I am not known, Yet how you miss me when I have flown.
When set loose, I fly away, Never so cursed as when I go astray.
Lighter than what I am made of, More of me is hidden Than is seen.
Three lives have I. Gentle enough to soothe the skin, Light enough to caress the sky, Hard enough to crack rocks.
